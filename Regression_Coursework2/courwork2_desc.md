# Regression Coursework2
In this coursework, I engaged in an in-depth exploration of Lasso regression, a powerful technique in linear regression analysis used for variable selection and regularization.
### Overview
- Focus on Lasso Regression: Learned to apply Lasso regression for variable selection and regularization in linear models.
- Optimizing Alpha Value: Used LassoCV for cross-validation to find the optimal alpha value that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Balancing Model Complexity: Gained insights into balancing model complexity and accuracy, crucial for preventing overfitting.
- Practical Model Tuning: Developed practical skills in model tuning and understanding the role of regularization in linear regression optimization.
