# The Case of the Hot Hand
This project delves into the fascinating concept of the 'hot hand' in basketball, a phenomenon where players are perceived to have periods of exceptional performance. Using a mix of regression analysis and hypothesis testing, the project explores this idea in-depth, employing NBA data from the 2012/2013 season.

### Part 1: Regression Analysis
#### Objective
- Develop a linear model to relate various player performance metrics to their salaries.
#### Approach
- Data Visualization: Histograms and scatterplots to explore relationships between salary and performance indicators like age, field goals, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and points.
- Model Development: Multiple regression models were constructed. The initial model excludes points as a predictor, and subsequent models incorporate logarithmic transformations and standardized coefficients for better insights.
### Part 2: Hot Hand Hypothesis Testing
#### Approach
- Conditional Probability Analysis: Examined the probability of players making a shot after both successful and missed shots, using real NBA player data.
- Streaks Approach: Investigated streaks or runs of successful shots. Developed a simulation model to compare observed shooting runs with theoretical expectations, providing a framework to test the hot hand hypothesis.
### Part 3: Conclusion
The project combines theoretical modeling with practical data analysis, offering insights into whether the 'hot hand' phenomenon can be statistically validated in professional basketball.
